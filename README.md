StormBit VPN Management Interface
===========

What the heck is it?
=======

It's a management interface for our VPN service. It allows users to register, login, and download their generated client config and keys.

Why? Isn't there stuff out there that does just that?
=======

Yes, there is. We wanted to put together our own software, and make it available to those who want it, be it some business, or just a community like us looking for some solution.
